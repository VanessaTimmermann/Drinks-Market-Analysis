### Withdrawal from Sale
For potential withdrawal from sale, the bottom four flavours were looked in depth. If flavours can be withdrawn individually from sale in any market, the highlighted flavours per market with each a revenue of below £1k would be suggested. If however production across all markets would need to be ceased, there are several options, depending on the overall goal.
